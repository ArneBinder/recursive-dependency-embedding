========
 * fixed (optimized, now usable) train_iter for concat_mode=aggregate
 * (inner) batching in batch_iter_all

22-04-18
========
 * filter out List_of_... dbpedianif articles (source + target roots):
     max size of tokens per article decreases from >11k to 5k
 * added length threshold for concat_mode==aggregate (default: 1k) in tree_iterator
 * fixed batch_iter_nearest for DummyTreeModel (tfidf)
 * note: batch_iter_nearest can lead to crashes because normed_embeddings stays in gpu memory

24-04-18
========
 * use softmax over candidates in TreeTupleModel_with_candidates
 * normalize gold_probs in max entropy calculation of TreeTupleModel_with_candidates (and return un-normalized for eval)
 * embedding_api: prepared integration of TreeTupleModel_with_candidates usage

25-04-18
========
 * create model_nearest only if batch_iter_nearest is used (for test/train)
