# Training recursive neural models with hierarchical linguistic information for semantic NLP tasks


A lot of annotation tools (POS, DEP, NER, etc.) are available that produce decent results for discrete feature calculation.
With neural networks, higher order tasks implicitly create internal vector representations of these features. But these features encode common concepts.


OUTPUT: Transferable embeddings for (automatically created) discrete features
